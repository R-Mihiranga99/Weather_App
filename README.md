# 🌤️ Weather App

A modern, responsive web application that displays real-time weather information for cities around the world using the **OpenWeather API**.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Weather App** lets users search for weather data by city name and view current conditions such as temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and more. It uses **JavaScript** to request data from the **OpenWeather API** and dynamically updates the UI. This web app was built to practice API integration, async programming, and responsive UI design.
